//Still figuring out preference assignment. Right now, assigns mpr, 
//then for each remaining slot finds a viable player. 
//Going to try inverse: for each player, find empty slot that will satisfy preference

//Does not yet do checks for three additional rules
//However theoretically, the way the code it structured, it would be relatively easy
//to incorporate these rules and other additional rules without ruining flow of code
//
//After MPR is done, checks to determine viable players for empty spots are done independently

//Right now, 


Fixes since last time: 
  -MPR fully implemented even considering preferences
    -Works for certain sets of players preferences. Still buggy. Certain other preference sets will end up with deadlocks with empty positions
    -Need to develop swap algorithm if that happens??

//-Prefer/Avoid position checkmarks will autocorrect if both selected for same position
//-Allow set inning to pitch, and will autocorrect if two players pitch same inning
//  -POTENTIAL ISSUE?: Right now can only manually select player to pitch 1 round
//  -If want to pitch more than 1 round, would have to set as preference and let algorithm set
//  -Otherwise no way to manually set 2+ rounds of pitching. Keep this or no?
//    -For manually set multiple inning pitch, would have to redesign UI a bit


Need implement:
->player movement up down????
        *Note* Players higher on the list are more pri <br><br>
