Originally try prototype with just single page html
-Difficult to provide second page?
-Problems with objects and data

Brute force?
Do pitcher each turn first.


Initial testing concerns:
Whether or not it would accurately fulfill the secondary conditions
  -Make suggestions on what necessary positions to add or remove? complex...


Bug fixes?
-Right now, allow pitch only once? 
-select interprets as string, not int


Need to solve algorithm:
Do one aspect at a time
As time goes on and there are no results, try to incorporate only minimum

object database might be useful. Unique keys makes doing things easy


make copy of master list

select and slice from 2nd list to put into inningPos list

use filled inningpos list to update master list attributes

priority system for preferences
  -high, mid, low priority
priority system for AA rules
  -give priority to those who havent fulfilled 2IF 1OF
